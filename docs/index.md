# Scalismo tutorials MARCH workshop

The following tutorials explain all the basic concepts behind Scalismo, which are needed for developing complete shape modelling applications.
The intention behind these tutorials is not only to show how to use the software, but also to help understanding the theoretical concepts underlying the software. 

Originally, these tutorials were designed as part of the Open Online Course [Statistical Shape Modelling - Computing the Human Anatomy](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/statistical-shape-modelling).  


### Preparation

To run the code in the tutorials, you will need to install the interpreter from a USB stick, or using the following link:
